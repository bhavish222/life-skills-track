## Good Practices for Software Development
### Question 1
#### Which point(s) were new to you?

- The emphasis on over-communicating in various scenarios, such as changes in requirements or unexpected issues during implementation, and the importance of informing relevant team members promptly.
- The recommendation to use tools like TimeLimit, Freedom, or Boosted for managing distractions and improving productivity during work hours.

### Question 2
#### Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

- Actively take notes during requirement discussions and follow up with written documentation to share with the team for immediate feedback.
- Ask more clarifying questions during meetings to ensure a thorough understanding of requirements and potential ambiguities.
- Incorporate tools like Trello or Jira for better documentation and organization of requirements, if not already in use within the team.

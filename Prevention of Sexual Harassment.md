   If I face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of sexual harassment, I would:
   - Clearly communicate that the behavior is unwelcome and unacceptable.
   - Document the details of the incident(s) including date, time, location, and individuals involved.
   - Report the harassment to a supervisor, HR department, or other appropriate authority within the organization.

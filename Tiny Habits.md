# Tiny Habits
### Question 1
In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

In this video, the most interesting idea for me was BJ Fogg's concept of "Tiny Habits" and how he emphasizes starting with small, achievable actions to build momentum towards larger changes.

#### Question 2
How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

B = MAP stands for Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt. To make new habits easier, you can use this formula by focusing on increasing motivation, making the behavior easier to do, and ensuring there's a clear prompt or trigger to initiate the behavior. 
- M: Motivation refers to the desire or drive to perform the behavior.
- A: Ability refers to how easy it is to perform the behavior.
- P: Prompt refers to the cue or trigger that initiates the behavior.

#### Question 3
Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)

Celebrating after each successful completion of a habit is important because it reinforces the behavior and makes it more likely to become a habit. When you celebrate, you create a positive association with the behavior, making it more enjoyable and satisfying, thus increasing the likelihood of repetition.

#### Question 4
In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

In this video, the most interesting idea for me was the concept of continuous improvement through small, incremental changes. The idea that consistent, small improvements can lead to significant progress over time resonated with me.

#### Question 5
What is the book's perspective about Identity?

The book emphasizes the importance of identity in habit formation. It suggests that by aligning your habits with the type of person you want to become, you can make behavior change more sustainable and effective.

#### Question 6
Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

To make a habit easier to do, the book suggests various strategies such as making the cue obvious, designing your environment to facilitate the behavior, and starting with small, manageable steps to build momentum.

#### Question 7
Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

To make a habit harder to do, the book recommends strategies like making the cue invisible, reducing exposure to temptations, and increasing the friction associated with the behavior.

#### Question 8
Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

One habit I would like to do more of is exercising regularly. To make it easier, I can:
- Make the cue obvious by setting out my workout clothes the night before.
- Make the habit more attractive by exercising with friends or listening to motivating music.
- Make the behavior easier by starting with short workouts and gradually increasing intensity.
- Make the response satisfying by rewarding myself after each workout with a healthy snack or some leisure time.

#### Question 9
Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

One habit I would like to eliminate or do less of is excessive social media scrolling. To make it less attractive or harder, I can:
- Make the cue invisible by removing social media apps from my phone's home screen.
- Make the process unattractive by setting time limits on social media usage or using apps that track and limit screen time.
- Make the response unsatisfying by replacing social media scrolling with more fulfilling activities such as reading, exercising, or spending time with loved ones.

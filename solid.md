# S.O.L.I.D Principle

## Single Responsibility Principle (S)
The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that a class should have only one reason to change. It's important because multiple teams working on the same class for different reasons can lead to incompatible modules. SRP facilitates easier version control and reduces merge conflicts by ensuring each file has a single responsibility.

## Open-Closed Principle (O)
The Open-Closed Principle (OCP) requires classes to be open for extension and closed for modification. It allows adding new functionality without altering existing code, minimizing the risk of introducing bugs. Interfaces and abstract classes facilitate adhering to this principle.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (L)
The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) ensures that objects of a superclass can be replaced by objects of its subclass without altering program behavior. It enables seamless substitution of objects, maintaining program consistency.

## Interface Segregation Principle (I)
The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) advocates for clients not to be forced to implement interfaces they don't use. It promotes cohesive interfaces to prevent interface pollution and unnecessary dependencies.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (D)
The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) suggests that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions. It decouples modules, promoting flexibility and easier maintenance.
